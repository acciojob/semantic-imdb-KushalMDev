            <h2>Summary of the plot</h2>
            <summary>Param, the son of a heart specialist Jayanth Rao, is eager to know many things in life, and keeps on
                shuffling from one place to another. A gold medallist in B.Sc, Param takes six attempts to obtain his
                M.Sc degree because of his friends, and is a rich guy and can do any task easily. Param falls in love
                with Deepa, but Sanvi is also in love with him. However, Param does not have any feelings other than
                that of a friend for the latter. He makes this clear and shows interest in getting Deepa as his partner
                in life. Convincing Deepa's family of this proves to be difficult. The proposal enrages Deepa, but soon
                falls for Param. Tragedy strikes Param, when Deepa dies after a few years, leaving Param with their
                child. At this juncture, Sanvi arrives to invite Param to her wedding. Param reacts in a very jovial
                manner, and seems to believe that although Deepa is not physically with him, but mentally she has not
                left him</summary>
